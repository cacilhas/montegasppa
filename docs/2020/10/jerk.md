I’ve just read a very interesting article called [La Fabrique du crétin digital](https://www.seuil.com/ouvrage/la-fabrique-du-cretin-digital-michel-desmurget/9782021423310), and the logical and virtually factual conclusion is the screen exposure time has a magical effect on the neurological development.

The _fact_ that supports that conclusion is that, for the first time in human history, the current generation presents an I.Q. lower than the previous.

Seems logical, doesn’t?

But there’s a (convenently) left-out fact: my generation was parented by an electronic babysitter called **TV**. We had an **extremely high** screen exposure time, and our generation has an average I.Q. higher than the our parents’.

In my point of view, the article’s hurried conclusion is biased, and I’m telling how.

I think there’s no magical effect: the electronic devices ain’t been used to expand the children capabilities, instead the adults’ve been used technology to build self-affirmation social bubbles where their realities are endorsed, and narrowed children development to those bubbles.

The lack of confrontation can dull grownups, just image what it can do to a developing mind… the cognitive capabilities are inevitably destroyed in this limiting context, leading to a whole generation mind atrophy.

However it’s way more comfortable to acuse an external demon (the technology in this case), rather than assuming the responsability and doing something about.

If the technology is to blame, it’s enough to put children away from it (alienating them), allowing us grownups to keep building bubbles, to keep making the same old mistakes – and nothing really changes.
