Sorry, I just get tired of my [old platform](//cacilhas.info/montegasppa/) and started over.

What annoyed me the most was the [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) notation. Don’t take me wrong, I really like Pug, but every single content transport required a translation to [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and I’m pissed off.

So, I decided set my blogs apart and use Markdown to write the posts.

I just couldn’t find a barely useful platform to use (please don’t come with that shit called Jekyll.)

After a lot of researching, I throwed it all up and started to code my own software.

I’m using [TypeScript](https://typescript.org/), [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/), [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), [Showdown](http://showdownjs.com/), [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/), and [YAML](https://yaml.org/).

Let’s see how long it goes.
