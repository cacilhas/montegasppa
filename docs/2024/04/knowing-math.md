Consider the following expression:

![W(2e²) + e^iπ](//cacilhas.info/img/math/w2e2+eipi.svg)

If you’re not a Mathematician, Physicist, Astronomer, or anything in hard sciences, you are not obliged to know how to solve it – no one has taught you it at school.

However, if I give you the required tools in this very post, and you still can’t solve it by using school algebra, it means you have no fitness for Exact Sciences – which is okay, that’s nothing wrong; it doesn’t make you worse or better than anyone else, maybe you got aptitude for something else.

But we can call **WRONG** people deeply debating about Physics, Astrophysics, Astronomy, Chemistry, and even Math sometimes, like they were misunderstood geniuses. (Yeah… I’m writing this post ’cause I’m fed up with those people.) 😖

No, kid! You aren’t a new “Einstein,” able to understand things that no expert can. It’s just the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.abebooks.com/9786130693619/DunningKruger-Effect-6130693613/plp) preventing you from realising you haven’t gotten even the basics.

By the way, here are all the tools you need to solve the expression above:

![W(zeᶻ) = z](//cacilhas.info/img/math/lamberts-W-function.svg)

![eᶿⁱ = cosθ + i sinθ](//cacilhas.info/img/math/euler.svg)

![sinπ = 0](//cacilhas.info/img/math/sinpi.svg)

![cosπ = -1](//cacilhas.info/img/math/cospi.svg)

Only school algebra and these definitions are enough to reach the result; if you still need to google it or to refer to [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/), Exact Sciences aren’t for you.

I must reiterate: that doesn’t mean you are less than anyone! Maybe you fit into Social Sciences! Just in the same way some Exact Sciences people are fully witless when it comes to politics and other social subjects. Just don’t try to refute ![General Relativity](//cacilhas.info/img/math/general-relativity.svg) if you didn’t get.
