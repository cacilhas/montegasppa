![Alphabet](//cacilhas.info/img/alphabet.png)

Last week I did the most naïve thing I could.

My son has a [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) connected to my [family group](https://families.google/), but his [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/) was getting really weird recommendations.

So I decided the worst: I gave my son’s real age to Alphabet, assuming YouTube would block weird, adult content.

That was quite the opposite.

All [gore](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Graphic_violence) and adult content is still being recommended, even though his account is now childish. I’m spending hours blocking violent, horror, and sexual content from its account, and **YouTube keeps making them come anyway**, no matter what I do.

In other hand, content from [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://www.biography.com/scientists/neil-degrasse-tyson), for instance, and science content refuting antivax, Flat Earth, or any other conspiracy bullshit, **are now blocked by YouTube**, classified as **inappropriate for children**.

Obviously antivax content, Flat Earth, and so are also considered _okay_ for children by YouTube, as well as gore.

Lemme put it in a clearer way:

**GOOGLE** CONSIDERS SCIENCE INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN.

But…

**GOOGLE** CONSIDERS GORE, SCIENTIFIC DENIALISM, AND SEXUAL INNUENDO OKAY FOR CHILDREN.
