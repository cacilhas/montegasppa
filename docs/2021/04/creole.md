Who’s used to read my posts might have noted I use terms like _lotta_, _getta_, _gotta_, _gonna_, _’cause_, _kinda_, _æsthetics_, _resumé_, _naïve_, _to be got_ (instead of _to have_), _façade_, _ain’t_ (usually in place of _haven’t_ or _hasn’t_), _dunno_ (instead of _don’t know_), _ad eterno_, _persona_, _et cetera_, a lot.

This kind of informal wordbook is called [**Creole**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language).

Creole languages are the most natural idioms that can be. They consist of local idiomatic expressions mixed with foreign words or variations.

Despite the formal interpretation of Creole languages (pedantic and elitist), those are the highest expression of culture growth and richness, reflected in and reflecting every subject philologically.

Creole influences exist in every natural language. My own native language, for instance, is a mix of [Portuguese](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/articles/11-fascinating-facts-about-the-portuguese-language/), [Ñe’engatú](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/nheengatu.htm), some [San Marino Italian](https://www.britannica.com/place/San-Marino-republic-Europe) expressions, and some African and Arabic words.

So I’m very proud of speaking a Creole language and of using a Creole English in my texts. In my perception, it’s an honor.

PS: I began to think about this topic reading the [Belter Creole page](https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Belter_Creole).
