The Ten Commandments:

1.  I am the Void thou may use to justify any crime; thou shalt not listen to facts or science.
2.  Take the biblical names as authority logical falacies.
3.  Supervise the other’s life with violence.
4.  Put the traditional family above everyone.
5.  Thou shalt not kill the rich or middle-class cis-hetero man (but kill everyone else).
6.  Supervise the other’s ass.
7.  Thou shalt not take back what the rich or middle-class cis-hetero man has taken from you.
8.  Thou shalt not say inconvinient truths.
9.  Thou shalt not covet the rich or middle-class cis-hetero man’s wife or daughter (but take every woman and/or non-white person else).
10.  Feel ashamed of every victory of thee, giving 30% of it to the slack priest for saving your guilty conscience.
