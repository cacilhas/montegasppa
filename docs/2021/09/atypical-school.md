Iâ€™m telling you a personal fresh case.

This week I and my wife were looking at the school camera images, and we saw a teacher grabbing our sonâ€™s arm fiercely.

We also saw an autistic girl left helpless on the yard.

We immediately contacted the principal for an explanation, and the principal literally **threatened** us telling the camera records had no registered aggression.

We insisted in seeing the records, and the principal called us to the school for a talk.

Meanwhile we told the autistic girlâ€™s mother what was happening.

When we got to the school, the principal said that there was **no camera record** for we to see, and call my wife hysterical, a clear mysogyne.

But Iâ€™m a man, and our mysogynist society doesnâ€™t call men hysterical. So I said I saw the same as my wife. The principal replied the teachers was _too busy_ to _act properly_.

I responded therefore the school staff is insufficient.

The principalâ€™s reaction was ridiculously emotional: she said I have _no right_ to question her decisions about the staff, that itâ€™s her competence â€“ or incompetence according to my assessment.

Letâ€™s repeat the principalâ€™s argument in clearer words: I, the **contracting party**, have no right to question the contracted service â€“ get it? My part in the contract is nothing but paying the bill and **shutting up**. ðŸ˜¡

Dâ€™ya remember we told the helpless girlâ€™s mother what had happened to her?

The principal said itâ€™s **perfectly normal an autistic child being left alone**, and she (the principal) _barely could sleep_ at night knowing **the childâ€™s mother is aware** of what was happening to her child.

Take heed: leaving an autistic child helpless on the yard **isnâ€™t** reason to lose the sleep, but it is **due the mother to know it**. ðŸ˜–

In other words: the principal has no emotional condition to deal with the reality, her particular truth cannot be confronted, and the facts must be discarded.

It looks like Iâ€™m complaining in vain, assaulting a single personâ€™s honor. Contrariwise Iâ€™m drawing a **culture scenery**.

In Brazil, social inclusion is taken as **welfarism**; expertise is synonymous with hiding facts and evidences; children are left by themselvesâ€¦ itâ€™s important to make money and _be normal_.
