As an Autist, I’m got some issues with my proprioception. A very common situation is when I break my toes.

Yesterday I was in a carrier facility where there is a gap in the floor hard to notice.

So I stumbled it and fell to the floor, breaking my big toe and luxating my knee.

That’s not a big deal, but there was another issue that makes people confused.

I was standing, then suddenly I was down, in a position I couldn’t identify: I simply couldn’t tell which way was up.

It took me a while to identify where was the floor and how I was setted, when I felt a weird gap near my feet, which makes me even more lost.

Again, it took me a while to find out that it was a short stair step. So I crawled to it, and then it got clear how I was setted. It allowed me to sit and get up again.

Meanwhile, people were worried, looking for a way to help, while I was trying to explain I was fine, I was just trying to figure out where I was.

How to explain such an issue to someone who ain’t go through it?
