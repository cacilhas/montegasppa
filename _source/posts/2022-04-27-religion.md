{:class="mg-first"} The **Christianism** doesn’t need to be oppressor,
but, unfortunately, things aren’t like you and I would like it were.

And the Christianism, like most religions, looks more like a psychological
disorder, leading people to group hallucinations and confirmation biases of
every manichæist idea.

We cannot simply deal with things as they were like we think they should be –
we need to deal with things **as they really are**.

And religion unfortunately has brought only disgrace and misery to the world.
It has always been the case, it will always be. There’s not a single moment in
the history of mankind when institutional religion had been constructive for
society.

I still think Jesus Christ’s words are very beautiful, an example in many
aspects, however any gathering around it, or around Bible, or around any
“sacred” book – Koran, Torah, Baghavad Gita, *et cetera* – should be
**banished** by good souls.

There’s a quote attributed sometimes to Voltaire, sometimes to Diderot,
that puts that in perspective:

— Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of
the last priest.

I would like to update it:

— Piece is unreachable until the last military is strangled with the entrails of
the last religious leader.

It’s necessary to make it clear that this is a hyperbole, an overstatement,
I’m not claiming for murdering.
