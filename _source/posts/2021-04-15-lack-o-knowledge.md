{:class="mg-first"} I’ve been really astonished by an unexpected fact: Computer
technicians are afraid of knowledge. 😱

I’m telling you something happened with my team with no fear of diminishing
anyone, ’cause the behaviour I’m describing isn’t an isolated case, but common
to many technicians, if not to most of us.

I brought to my team
<abbr title="I’m looking for that paper now, but I can’t found it. 😞">a paper</abbr>
about [algebraic data types][adt] that was relevant to a project we was
designing. The team reactions were since unbelief and repudiation to pure
**horror**.

And it was nothing but a trivial academic paper on Technology!!

Thenceforth I’ve been paying attention to how technicians learn, and I
discovered a very annoying reallity: technicians have learned from
**professional panelists**[¹](#panelist) and **programming gurudons** instead
of from formal education; they use tech-communities as information source
instead of a place for sharing it. 😲

So the academic slang sounds alien for most of software developers.

This week I was debating with an external asset, and he was defending a
plausable approach, but high-costed. I argued that approach, though plausable,
aggregates not enough value to justify the associated cost.

So he told me: “*We technicians* have always done that way, so it’s the right
way.” But **I’m a technician too!** 😤

That was my answer: that argument works for non-technicians; for me, he needed
to present a well-grounded technical explanation. And he wasn’t able to do
that.

That’s the same problem: an unaware technician trying to trick others to fake
knownledge. Unfortunately it’s the standard.

I’m here **begging you** to get out of panelists and gurudons, and rather inform
yourselves from proper sources; use communities to share your experience, not
in search of education.

If you wanna watch some good tech videos, refer to academic ones, [TED][ted],
[TEDEd][teded], and [TEDx][tedx], **not** stage developers and showman speakers.

Please…
