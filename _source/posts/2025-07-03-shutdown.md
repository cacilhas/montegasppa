:first Yesterday, July the 2nd, I have a **shutdown**.

Shutdown is an autistic crisis or event less often and totally different from a
meltdown.

On a shutdown, the autistic person is disconnected from the world for some hours
or even **days**. It’s like there’s no time: the brain stops – it’s not stuck,
but powerless.

I shut totally down from 14:00Z until 17:00Z, roughly. During that time, I was
simply off: no thoughts, no memories, no dreams, no emotions, no sensations…
only void. Not even time.

After that, my wife called me, which triggered me a comeback response. Thanks
to medication and a lotta willpower, I was able to get back slowly, and I was
finally up around 19:00Z.

I was sorta sluggish the rest of the day though, I simply couldn’t focus.

I’m not sure people understand the power of a shutdown. It isn’t a matter of
willpower (as my speech may’ve suggested): it’s chemical; a person in such an
event needs help.

Dunno why, but it feels like it’s important to be shared.
