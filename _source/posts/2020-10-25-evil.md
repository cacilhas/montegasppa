{:class="mg-first"} One can pass through life unaware of the evil, but not
untouched by it.

Evil is what happens when the shadow, choked by the superego’s tyranny, finds a
way out to be.

Why is evil so bound to religion and morality? ’Cause it’s their side effect.

The religion and morality are the remaining of the society proto-norms, born
from the prestige bias in many ways. So the evil is.

The prestige bias creates a distorted right-vs-wrong principle, nondetachably
bound to the first impressions (*principia*). It gives birth to an indissuadable
collective superego, ready to kill in its beliefs’ sake.

So, in self-defence the superego is capable of everything, fighting back ideas
or even facts that might put it in check.

That’s the chance the shadow was waiting for in order to get abroad. Now, like a
flogged wild beast, it jumps over the target, driven by the fury of all the
pique it has fed against the superego, controlled by the very same superego,
that focuses it against the potential menace.

This that I just described as “evil” is a constituent part of the human being.

And the religion? The morality?

This “evil” is the religion/morality’s core engine: the morality (and the
religion as morality’s fenomena) is the proto-norms’ consolidation, accusing
the “other” – *them* – of evil, heading to the other the rage-blind shadow demon
hound, which is the very evil itself.

The only way to defeat the evil is by killing the collective superego, creating
an individual one, companion of the shadow, in peace with it.

> Et ses mains ourdiraient les entrailles du prêtre,<br/>
> Au défaut d’un cordon pour étrangler les rois.<br/>
> ([Diderot][diderot])

This is a fierce quote, but if nonetheless taken symbolically, there’s no other
way to set human free.
