{:class="mg-first"} I have a lotta countryside stories I avoid telling, as
they would be a must in the hands of conspiracy theorists. It’s easy to take an
event we don’t fully understand and go further, creating unfounded guesses.

However, I’ve been through some bizarre situations though. There’s a particular
one from when I was a lad, which makes me believe that some things we don’t
understand lead people to create crazy conjectures about extraterrestrial
visitors.

Yet I wanna make it clear that none of these events is evidence of anything.

I lived in the countryside in my early thirties, a wooded and muddy place. The
house where I lived was at the bottom of a 9m ravine, and on the top, there was
a tree stump where one could have a good view of the house.

The whole place was dimly lit, and some nights I used to get home really late.

One night I got home around 3:00 AM, and there was a “little guy” bent over the
stump, looking down at the house. “It” must be around 1.20m to 1.40m,
humanoid-shaped, very thin, grey-skinned, no clothes (or at least looked like),
two big rounded deeply-black eyes. Of course, I got frozen! But it seemed not to
notice me, so I kept going on and walked down the stairs on the ravine slope
until I reached the house; it was up there looking down at the house (or at me),
so I got in. Nothing else happened that night.

The next night, having not learnt my lesson, I got home late again, at about the
same time. Then there was not only one, but **four** of those guys waiting: one
in the same position as the previous night, and three a little further, in a
circle near an old water tank.

When I noticed them, the three beside the tank turned in my direction and
started to walk slowly toward me. I think I haven’t ever come down those stairs
so fast before or since! I got inside as soon as I got the key in the lock – not
an easy task when you’re panicking.

I really don’t know what they were or wanted, but I know I saw them, and I know
there’s no clue about their origin; saying they were unworldly is an extremely
rough assumption.

I hope it’s clear why I avoid telling those stories: all it takes is an
astrologer, ufologist, or a conspiracy theorist to turn it into crazy
sensationalist news. On the other hand, there are pseudo-skeptics that, instead
of doubting, strongly believe it’s fake, mocking anything can’t explain.
