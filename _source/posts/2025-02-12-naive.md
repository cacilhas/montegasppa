:right ![Alphabet][image]

:first Last week I did the most naïve thing I could.

My son has a [Google Account][] connected to my [family group][], but his
[YouTube account][] was getting really weird recommendations.

So I decided the worst: I gave my son’s real age to Alphabet, assuming YouTube
would block weird, adult content.

That was quite the opposite.

All [gore][] and adult content is still being recommended, even though his
account is now childish. I’m spending hours blocking violent, horror, and sexual
content from its account, and **YouTube keeps making them come anyway**, no
matter what I do.

In other hand, content from [Neil deGrasse Tyson][], for instance, and science
content refuting antivax, Flat Earth, or any other conspiracy bullshit,
**are now blocked by YouTube**, classified as **inappropriate for children**.

Obviously antivax content, Flat Earth, violence, and so are also considered
*okay* for children by YouTube, as well as gore.

Lemme put it in a clearer way:

:centre **GOOGLE** CONSIDERS SCIENCE INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN.

But…

:centre **GOOGLE** CONSIDERS GORE, SCIENTIFIC DENIALISM, AND SEXUAL INNUENDO
  OKAY FOR CHILDREN.

*Heil USA and their transnational big techs…*
