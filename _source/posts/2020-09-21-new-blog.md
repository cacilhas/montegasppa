:first Sorry, I just get tired of my [old platform][] and started over.

What annoyed me the most was the [Pug][] notation. Don’t take me wrong, I really
like Pug, but every single content transport required a translation to
[Markdown][], and I’m pissed off.

So, I decided set my blogs apart and use Markdown to write the posts.

I just couldn’t find a barely useful platform to use (please don’t come with
that shit called Jekyll.)

After a lot of researching, I throwed it all up and started to code my own
software.

I’m using [TypeScript][], [CoffeeScript][], [Mustache][], [Showdown][],
[Stylus][], and [YAML][].

Let’s see how long it goes.
