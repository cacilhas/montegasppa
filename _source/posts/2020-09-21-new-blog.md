{:class="mg-first"} Sorry, I just get tired of my
<a href="{{{ cacilhas.url }}}/montegasppa/">old platform</a> and started over.

What annoyed me the most was the [Pug][pug] notation. Don’t take me wrong, I
really like Pug, but every single content transport required a translation to
[Markdown][markdown], and I’m pissed off.

So, I decided set my blogs apart and use Markdown to write the posts.

I just couldn’t find a barely useful platform to use (please don’t come with
that shit called Jekyll.)

After a lot of researching, I throwed it all up and started to code my own
software.

I’m using [TypeScript][typescript], [CoffeeScript][coffeescript],
[Mustache][mustache], [Showdown][showdown], [Stylus][stylus], and [YAML][yaml].

Let’s see how long it goes.
