{:class="mg-first"} I’ve just read a very interesting article called
[La Fabrique du crétin digital][], and the logical and virtually factual
conclusion is the screen exposure time has a magical effect on the neurological
development.

The *fact* that supports that conclusion is that, for the first time in human
history, the current generation presents an I.Q. lower than the previous.

Seems logical, doesn’t it?

But there’s a (convenently) left-out fact: my generation was parented by an
electronic babysitter called **TV**. We had an **extremely high** screen
exposure time, and our generation has an average I.Q. higher than the our
parents’.

In my point of view, the article’s hurried conclusion is biased, and I’m telling
how.

I think there’s no magical effect: the electronic devices ain’t been used to
expand the children capabilities, instead the adults’ve been used technology to
build self-affirmation social bubbles where their realities are endorsed, and
narrowed children development to those bubbles.

The lack of confrontation can dull grownups, just image what it can do to a
developing mind… the cognitive capabilities are inevitably destroyed in this
limiting context, leading to a whole generation mind atrophy.

However it’s way more comfortable to acuse an external demon (the technology in
this case), rather than assuming the responsability and doing something about.

If the technology’s to blame, it must’ve been enough to put children away from
it (alien’ing them), but allowing us grownups to keep building bubbles, to keep
making the same old mistakes – and nothing really changes.
