:first For those who say that everybody is a little bit Autistic, here are the
[DSM-5][] Autistic diagnostic criteria:

- **[A1]** Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, from abnormal
  social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation, to reduced
  sharing of interests, emotions, or affect, to failure to initiate or respond
  to social interactions.
- **[A2]** Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social
  interaction, ranging, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal
  communication, to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits
  in understanding and use of gestures, to a total lack of facial expressions
  and nonverbal communication.
- **[A3]** Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships,
  ranging, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts,
  to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends, to absence
  of interest in peers.
- **[B1]** Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech
  – e.g. simple motor stereotypes, lining up toys or flipping objects,
  echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases.
- **[B2]** Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or
  ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior – e.g. extreme distress at
  small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns,
  greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day.
- **[B3]** Hyperfocus: highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in
  intensity or focus – e.g. strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual
  objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests.
- **[B4]** Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in
  sensory aspects of the environment – e.g. apparent indifference to
  pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive
  smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement.
