:first Excuse my lack of modesty, but I’m good at what I do. I’m not even close
to be the best though, but I’m way above average. It’s due to what I’ve learned
over more than 20 years of work experience, and I’d like to share some of the
simpler and more efficient tips I got.


## Affection

Don’t fall in love with technology and, even more important, don’t get attached
to your code.

The code you wrote is **NOT** your son – neither your boyfriend, nor your
girlfriend, nor your mother, nor whatelse. Your code is a by-product of turning
coffee into shit, a “stuff.” And just like many stuff, it’s meant to be used,
not loved.

Look at your code as a necessary evil to be discarded as soon as it’s no longer
needed.

Do the same facing technologies: programming languages, frameworks, engines, and
even methodologies are tools, not rules. Use them wisely, discard each one when
you can.


## Design

Avoid writing code. Design it first.

Of course you can prospect by coding, however discard it when you head the final
code, keep only the cleanest one.

My current job is to find value by just deleting code, and I have virtually
implemented features by deleting code!

How is it possible?

Imagine a TV that isn’t working. It’s plugged to an adapter… which is plugged
to another adapter… which is plugged to a third one! The last one is plugged to
an extension. Than you look at that, remove the adapters, and plug the TV
electrical connector directly to the extension, and *voilà*! The TV magically
turns on!

That’s pretty much what I’ve been doing, but why?

Because people don’t design. They simply write random code like typing monkeys,
hoping something will eventually work.

It leads us to the next topic.


## Rely but don’t trust

Use methodologies, but don’t let methodologies use you.

Rely on
^^abbr(title="Test-driven Development")[TDD][test-driven]^^,
^^abbr(title="Type-driven Development")[TDD][type-driven]^^,
[SOLID][],
^^abbr(title="Domain-driven Design")[DDD][]^^,
^^abbr(title="Compiling-driven Development")[CDD][]^^,
^^abbr(title="Aspect-oriented Programming")[AOP][]^^,
^^abbr(title="Algebraic Data Type")[ADT][]^^,
but always revisit the concepts and adapt them to your real-world needs.


## Conformism

Never ever be fully satisfied by yourself. I never know enough, I’m always
looking for the next subject or getting deeper in something I’ve learned, so you
should too.

Those are the tips I have for you today.
