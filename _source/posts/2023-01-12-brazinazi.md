:right ![Nazism in Brazil][image]

:first Brazil’s democracy is under attack. A large **fascist** group is
performing coordinated **terrorist attacks**, asking for the end of Democracy
– literally. Those people are united by a wide range of different kinds of hate.

Some don’t want poor people to have enough to eat.

Others are angry with African-origin religions.

There are those who hate black people and those who want gays dead.

Every single one is under the anti-Communism excuse umbrella, even if most of
them have no idea about what Communism is though.

So when a group broke through into the Congress hall, the most violent ones
started destroying everything they found, and then everyone else was following,
compelled by the shared hatred and the crowd.

The (non-self-aware) fascists who weren’t there are saying they would never take
part in that acts, but they aren’t considering they themselves are also reined
by the same **hatred**.

That’s what’s going on in Brazil: undemocratic **HATE** against fairness.
