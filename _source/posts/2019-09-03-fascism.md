{:class="mg-first"} Umberto Eco warned us about the [Ur-Fascism][ur-fascism], that visceral one,
beginningless and endless, as old as man.

It’s that **fearful** feeling of belonging, virtually an addiction to the
sameness, showing up as tradition need and diversity loathing; fed back by fear,
uncertainty and doubt.

The Ur-Fascism lies within the so-called [*godly*¹ *men*](#godly)’s heart: that
guy (or lady) who’s attached to the morality and the good manners, God fearer,
who tolerates nothing but what fits his/her righteous box.

“Us and Them:” this is the Ur-Fascism.

So the Ur-Fascist, far-right he/she is, avoids (or was avoiding) hearing
Hitler’s words, so much so he/she fears to find himself/herself in that speech.

The Ur-Fascist thus calls *Reductio ad Hitlerum* every evidence that unveil the
fascist reality of his/her mindset.

On his/her biased world perspective,
[Nazism *must* be left-wing][nazis-not-social], ’cause the Ur-Fascist has
elected the Left-Wing as The Evil-on-Earth, so every negative idea shall be
assigned to the enemy, making sense or not.

### Enter the Neofascism

This ubiquitous Fallacy Fallacy (accusing every opponent for
*Reductio ad Hitlerum*) led the Ur-Fascism to grow fast and tough, and now it’s
becoming so strong, that its veiling is no longer needed.

We’re watching the development of a new shameless kinda Fascism, the
[**Neofascism**][neofascism].

After so many years of living in the shades, the Neofascism can finally take
advantage of people’s so-long veiled Ur-Fascist heart and show itself. More and
more the neofascist groups gain supporters. They’re not afraid to call
themselves so.

They’re using the fact people are indeed fascist to wipe the Fascism’s bad
reputation out.

### Sad but true

*Hic et nunc* I can’t see a light of hope. People are fascist, the human race
seems to be essentially perverse. The humankind’s future points to barbarism,
grudge and hatred.

{:id="godly"} ¹*Godly men*: I was thinking about the well-known sentence “good
men,” but I thought twice and found “godly” a more appropriate word.
