:first I’m a Marvel movies’ fan; in fact, I’m a Disney movies’ fan.

Of cource I have my complaints. For instance, I’m very bothered by the Disney’s
sanitised æsthetics and its resultless violence.

Nevertheless I feel very attached to the Marvel movies, I like the saga.

But something is disturbing me: in addiction to “action” and “adventure”, the
streaming platforms have classified those movies as “sci-fi”.

In my sight – and this is very personal – I think about **scientific** fiction
as fiction taken from **science**, so I expect some science. It sounds logical,
doesn’t it?

But those adventure movies takes use of a very lazy approach:

> [Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.][]

So there’s not even a minimal effort to provide a narrowed explanation, the
fictional technology is just dropped in the movie like magic.

There’s no problem in doing that, the problem is doing that and classifying it
as *scientific* fiction.

I think (again enphasis on “I”) there should be a new move class called
“technological fiction” (“tech-fi” for short), where the science behind the tech
is not relevant; or we could take off the “Science” and the “Math” from [STEM][]
and create a “TEM fiction” – Technology, Engineering, and Magic.

Think about it.
