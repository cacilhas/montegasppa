:first There’s something beautiful about small natural numbers, mainly about
their relation to the human psyché.

I’m taking zero out, ’cause, even some says zero is natural, natural numbers are
countable; I challenge you to count zero.

**1** (one) is the unit, the origin. Without one there’s no one, everything
starts with one; the first anything.

**2** (two) is one plus one, and this simple operation is very meaningful:

- Two is the first one (2 = 1 + **1**)
- after (2 = 1 **+** 1)
- the first number (2 = **1** + 1).

If you got a problem, you solve that problem; but if you got two problems,
you’re obliged to generalise the solution for the first time.

Two is the first prime, the first even – the only even prime. The pair.

**3** (three) is two plus one, and that’s meaningful too: three is the result of
the simpliest operation (3 = 2 **+** 1) between the simpliest numbers. It’s the
offspring, the odd one after one:

- The first Gaußsche prime;
- The first lucky prime;
- The first proth prime;
- The first Mersenne prime;
- The first Fermat prime.

**4** (Four) is the first square after one, representing the square idea itself.

Four equals to the product of its own isometric sum elements (2 + 2 = 2 × 2). By
the way: 4 = 2 + 2 = 2 × 2 = 2²

**5** (five) is the number of elements of the smallest meaningful field. It’s
the only untouchable odd number.

**6** (six) is the first number that is neither a square not a prime number; the
first perfect number. The hexagon has edges of the same size of its radio,
making it the perfect natural bidimensional form.

**7** (seven) is the only Mersenne safe prime, highly associated to luck in the
Judeo-Christian culture, but not only.

**8** (eight) the first cube after one, representing the 3-dimensionality
itself. The only natural perfect power that’s one less than another perfect
power.

Sphenic numbers have eight divisors.

Have you gotten any interesting natural number fact?
