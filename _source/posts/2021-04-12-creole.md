{:class="mg-first"} Who’s used to read my posts might have noted I use terms
like *lotta*, *getta*, *gotta*, *gonna*, *’cause*, *kinda*, *æsthetics*,
*resumé*, *naïve*, *to be got* (instead of *to have*), *façade*, *ain’t*
(usually in place of *haven’t* or *hasn’t*), *dunno* (instead of *don’t know*),
*ad eterno*, *persona*, *et cetera*, a lot.

This kind of informal wordbook is called [**Creole**][creole-lang].

Creole languages are the most natural idioms that can be. They consist of
local idiomatic expressions mixed with foreign words or variations.

Despite the formal interpretation of Creole languages (pedantic and elitist),
those are the highest expression of culture growth and richness, reflected in
and reflecting every subject philologically.

Creole influences exist in every natural language. My own native language,
for instance, is a mix of [Portuguese][pt-facts], [Ñe’engatú][nheengatu],
some [San Marino Italian][san-marino] expressions, and some African and Arabic
words.

So I’m very proud of speaking a Creole language and of using a Creole English
in my texts. In my perception, it’s an honor.
