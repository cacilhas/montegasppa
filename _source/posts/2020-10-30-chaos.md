{:class="mg-first"} I’ve been chaotic my whole life, everything I’ve done
wrong was trying to put some order in it.

Until I got an epiphany: **I am** the **chaos**, ’cause the universe is chaos.

People are afraid of the the chaos ’cause they are evil, thereat they need rules
(order) to keep’em in line. What they don’t known (or pretend not to know) is
that the order is just an excuse for them to be evil.

— Not my fault, only following orders.

That sentence enables bad people to do bad things. But that’s okay! Everything
is gonna be alright as long as we follow the rules – or maybe not.

The evil is evil, even under order.

The only way to defeat the evil is making peace with one’s inner demons.
Remember demons are fallen angels – well… not exactly. They’re closer to
_falling_ angels.

It’s because the fall of angels isn’t passed, it happens everyday inside us. All
the time.

If you stop throwing the angels, they stop falling. If you make peace with the
demons, they stop haunting you.

And the evil ceases to exist.

That’s why I can be chaos, ’cause I know my demons.
