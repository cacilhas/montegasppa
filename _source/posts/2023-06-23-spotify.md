:first Actually I don’t wanna talk exactly about [Spotify][], but more precisely
about **[DistroKid][]**.

There is this distributor that intermediates sharing music with Spotify and
other music shops. DistroKids apparently does a lotta cools things for you: it
register your songs, create your albums and publish ’em into several stream
services such as Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon.

Hence I decided to publish my albums by using DistroKid. So I created an
account, uploaded my songs, and published my albums.

That did for a while, until my third album, so I start having problems.

DistroKid refused to publish my third album claiming copyright issues.

That was very weird, ’cause I’ve always been very careful with everything I do:
what wasn’t recorded by myself is public-use SFX I’ve collected.

I asked DistroKid what was the illegal record, but they was refusing to tell me
any details. The better answer they gave me was “you know.”

After a long while trying to figure that out, they finally gave me a tip: I was
re-releasing songs that I had already released in other album.

So I got aware: all those songs I had **payed** for registration, DistroKid had
registered for itself, not in my name!! I no longer own my own songs, DistroKid
had **stollen** them from me.

Well… I should’ve pay attention to the small characters…

Thenceforth I stopped using DistroKid and quit publishing to Spotify.

Even so DistroKid still keeps threating me.

So here’s the warning: **don’t trust DistroKid**.

BTW you can find all my albums on [Bandcamp][].
