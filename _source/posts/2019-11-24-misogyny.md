:first I‚Äôve been watching the **Cosmic Front** series on [Curiosity Stream][],
and I realised something highly worrying.

The dark matter was discovered in 1970 by [Vera Rubin][]. David Bennett supposed
that the gravitational effect accredited to the dark matter should be caused by
dark stars (a several different kinds of dwarf stars). He led a research in
order to prove his hypothesis.

Unlike the expected, the antithesis arose from the results: the dark stars
amount is not enough to explain the dark matter gravitational effect ‚Äì in fact
it‚Äôs less than 1% of the required.

Bennett has been unhappy with his discovery. He declared his frustration in
**not being able to beat a woman**. Notice that the big issue has been that the
dark matter‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs discovery.

For one decade the dark matter very existence was widely rejected just because
**it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs discovery**.

We thought misogyny was a 4chan guys‚Äô thing, fruit of gamer lists and things
like that, but it isn‚Äôt: **the misogyny is a social institution**.

Part of the rejection to the M87 black hole picture‚Äôs veracity is because of the
project [tech leader is a woman][Katie Bouman]. Those men who believe in its
veracity credit the guys in the team for the achievement instead of her
leadership ‚Äì everyone trying to diminish the women‚Äôs worth.

[Donald Lyndel-Bell][] dedicated his life to massive black holes‚Äô research. He
supposed three hypotheses for their existence:

1. Lots of ordinary black holes merged into each massive one;
1. Ordinary black holes has eaten gas until become massive ones;
1. The massive black holes was born in the early universe among the first stars
   and galaxies, result of direct cloud collapses.

The first hypothesis fell apart when computer simulations proves the universe is
too young for massive black holes emerge from small one‚Äôs merges, leaving the
two other possibilities.

But according to the mass adding hypothesis, there couldn‚Äôt be massive black
holes in the inception of the universe. [Priyamvada Natarajan][] was able to
identify those impossible objects, discarding the second hypothesis in favor of
the third.

But the direct cloud collapse hypothesis is still reject by the community just
because it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs proof.

[Marie Curie][], [Ada Lovelace][], [RDML Grace Hopper][], [Vera Rubin][],
[Katie Bouman][], [Margaret Hamilton][], [Priyamvada Natarajan][], all those
women have been diminished in their importance, but the real fact is that the
women have been as important as men for science evolution ‚Äì if not more so:
behind every great man there was a supportive woman without whom he could not
be that great, while behind every great woman there has always been a prejudice
force telling her she was not able. üêù
