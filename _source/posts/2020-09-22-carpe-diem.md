{:class="mg-first"} In most job interviews, the interviewer ask to the
interviewee: “Where do you see yourself in five years?”

Really? I cannot even tell if I’ll be alive in five years!

People live their lives always planning for the future (not to mention soffering
for the past), prospecting, **controlling**.

Let me tell you a secret: **there’s no such thing as *control***.

A relative asked me about my hair, how long it “goes.” I answered I didn’t know
my hair was going anywhere. The honest answer would be “I don’t care.”

I used to live for the plans yet, when I was young. As the time goes on, I’ve
realised there’s no time for prospecting. [Just be here now][midnight-gospel].
