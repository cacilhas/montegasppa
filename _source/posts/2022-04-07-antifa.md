[Roger Waters]: https://rogerwaters.com/

{:class="mg-first"} Yesterday I read about a British singer saying that
[Roger Waters][]’s opinion is bullshit, ’cause everybody hates him.

Why does everybody hate him?

According to that signer, Waters is hated because he shouldn’t take sides in
Politics.

In short: **because Roger Waters is ANTIFA**.

If being Antifa is a reason for being rated, I’m sure that’s the right reason.

I’m really glad that those shit people hate me too.
