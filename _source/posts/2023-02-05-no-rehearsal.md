:first Life is no rehearsal, so live it straight, be kind though.

Fix what you can; what you can’t, accept it. Living has no purpose, so make
sense of it: Life means what you set it to.

Death is coming for everyone, you can’t do anything about it, so embrace it,
don’t be afraid (it’s pointless).

Every day is a gift, take it.
