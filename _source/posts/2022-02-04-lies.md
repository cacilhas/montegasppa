:right ![Autism][image]

:first I am autistic and I have my half-truth skill broken.

It’s simply hard for me to tell a lie or a half truth – not impossible, but very
hard. And neurotypical people are telling lies and half truths all the time.

Furthermore people keep offering me jobs where I’d need to talk to customers,
but I wouldn’t be allowed to tell ’em the truth, only the part that’s
convenient for the customers to be aware.

I simply can’t do that: despite it’s natural to everyone else, it’s against
what I am.

Therefore neurotypical people treat me as I’d be *less people* ’cause I’m not
fully able to lie.

You neurotypical have been lying to me, and you’ve been lying to each other,
and you consider yourselves *better* for lying!

I’m not okay with that.
