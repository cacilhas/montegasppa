{:class="mg-first"} I was born **Rodrigo M. Cacilhas** at Petrópolis/RJ, Brazil,
at 1975’s end, I got the nickname [Archimedes][archimedes] when I whas 10, for
math sciences are usually easy to me – and for bullying too, since some fellow
students wanted to make fun of the gold crown incident. Later, I changed the
spelling to **Arĥimedeς** when I became [esperantist][esperanto] (the final
greek sigma has nothing to do with the Esperanto).

I’m autistic, high gifted and musician, I was learning music from an early age
from my mother, who had been singer. I can play a lot of musical instruments –
strings, fife, and some keyboard ones.

I studied Chemistry at [UFRJ’s Chemistry Institute][ufrj-iq], but I didn’t
graduate.

I’ve learned how to deal with computers since very early on, I began using a
[TK85][tk85]. I was 12 when started programming on a
[MSX-1.1 Hotbit HB-8000][hotbit], using MS XColour BASIC programming language.
Later I switched to [Perl 5][perl], [C][c], [Python][python],at that time in the
version 1.5, which became my main programming language. I’ve also developed
professionaly in [Lua][lua], [Java][java], [C++][c++], [Cython][cython], and
about 2016 [ECMAScript 2015 / Javascript][ecma6], [TypeScript][typescript], and
[Go][go]. Currently I’m working in [Scala][scala].

I’ve learned a lot of programming languages just for self-improvement, among
them [Scheme][racket], [MoonScript][moonscript], [Erlang][erlang],
[Prolog][swi], [Standard ML][sml], [OCaml][ocaml], [F♯][f#],
[Smalltalk][cincom], [Objective-C][objc], [Tcl/Tk][tcl].

I went to FAETERJ IT Tecnological college, completing the course with 9.5
achievement. I was removed by political persecution. Later I was reintegrated,
and I graduated at the end of 2018.

I worked as hodman, tent loader, even storyteller, network administrator, IT
consultant and software developer.

Due to my Apraxia of Speech, it’s easy to me learning new languages’ structure,
but pronounciation and vocabulary are hard.

My great-grandfather was called Gasppar Montini at [San Marino][sanmarino], but
but he changed his name to Monte Gasppa in Brazil, whence I take my
**ℳontegasppα**, completing my public name. my great-grandmather’s name was
Giulia Campimori, renamed to Julia Monte.
