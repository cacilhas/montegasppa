:first I was born **Rodrigo M. Cacilhas** at Petrópolis/RJ, Brazil, at 1975’s
end, I got the nickname [Archimedes][] when I was 10, for math sciences are
usually easy to me – and for bullying too, since some fellow students wanted
to make fun of the gold crown incident. Later, I changed the spelling to
**Arĥimedeς** when I became [esperantist][] (the final greek sigma has nothing
to do with the Esperanto).

I’m autistic, high gifted and musician, I was learning music from an early age
from my mother, who had been singer. I can play a lot of musical instruments –
strings, fife, and some keyboard ones.

I studied Chemistry at [UFRJ’s Chemistry Institute][], but I didn’t graduate.

I’ve learned how to deal with computers since very early on, I began using a
[TK85][]. I was 12 when started programming on a [MSX-1.1 Hotbit HB-8000][],
using MS XColour BASIC programming language.
Later I switched to [Perl 5][], [C][], [Python][], at that time in the version
1.5, which became my main programming language. I’ve also developed
professionaly in [Lua][], [Java][], [C++][], [Cython][], and about 2016
[ECMAScript 2015 / Javascript][], [TypeScript][], and [Go][]. Currently I’m
working in [Scala][].

I’ve learned a lot of programming languages just for self-improvement, among
them [Scheme][], [MoonScript][], [Erlang][], [Prolog][], [Standard ML][],
[OCaml][], [F♯][], [Smalltalk][], [Objective-C][], [Tcl/Tk][].

I went to FAETERJ BTech college, completing the course with 9.5 achievement, and
was removed by political persecution. Later I was reintegrated, and I graduated
at the end of 2018.

I worked as hodman, tent loader, even storyteller, network administrator, IT
consultant and software developer.

Due to my [Apraxia of Speech][], it’s easy to me learning new languages’
structure, but pronounciation and vocabulary are tough.

My great-grandfather was called Gasppar Montini at [San Marino][], but he
changed his name to Monte Gasppa in Brazil, whence I take my **ℳontegasppα**,
completing my public name. my great-grandmather’s name was Giulia Campimori,
renamed to Julia Monte.
